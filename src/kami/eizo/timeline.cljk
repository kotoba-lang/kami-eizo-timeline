  "Portable EDL/timeline data model — the video-domain analog of what
  Premiere Pro / DaVinci Resolve / Avid Media Composer store internally as
  an Edit Decision List. Pure data + validation; no render execution, no
  interchange-format (CMX3600/OTIO/FCPXML) export in v0 — see README.

  All positions and durations are integer frame counts against an explicit
  `kami.eizo.timeline.timecode` timebase, never float seconds."
